### Stable Diffusion

# Stable Diffusion

This repository provides an implementation of Stable Diffusion, a powerful model for generating images from textual descriptions. The implementation utilizes pre-trained models and demonstrates how to encode text prompts into latent representations for image generation.

## Features

- Integrates with the Stable Diffusion model architecture
- Generates images based on text prompts
- Supports image generation using GPU acceleration
- Allows for experimentation with different prompts and generation parameters

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- transformers
- diffusers
- accelerate
- bitsandbytes
- PIL

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers diffusers accelerate bitsandbytes
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stable-diffusion.git
  cd stable-diffusion
  ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

  ```bash
  jupyter notebook stable-diffusion.ipynb
  ```

3. **Follow the instructions in the notebook to generate images from text prompts.**

## Example Prompts
- "a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse"
- "a campfire (oil on canvas)"
